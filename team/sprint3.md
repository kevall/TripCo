# Sprint 3 - *T16* - *Off the (ASCII) Chart*

## Goal

### A web based solution with shorter trips and a large data source.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan 

User stories (epics) in the Sprint Backlog: *#69, #70, #71, #72 (optional), #73 (optional)*.  

Total planned tasks / issues in the Sprint Backlog: *20* 

## Daily Scrums

Date | Tasks done this time | Tasks done next time | Impediments | Confidence
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
*10/2* | *none* | *#69, #70, #71* | *We need to create more issues and use Zenhub much more than the past sprints.* | *Medium-low*
*10/4* | *none* | *All issues* | *We need to focus much more on our process to make this sprint as clean and organized as possible.* | *High*
*10/6* | *none* | *All issues* | *Our nearest neighbor still has a bug that needs to be resolved.* | *Medium-high*
*10/9* | *none* | *All issues* | *We keep making small edits and new commits without creating issues for them.* | *Medium-high*
*10/11* | *none* | *All issues* | *We need to get a better understanding of what we are supposed to accomplish in each of our epics.* | *Medium*
*10/13* | *#97, #91* | *#74, #76, #80, #81, #83, #86, #95, #96, #98, #108, #112* | *We were having trouble making sure that all of our paths are connected properly.* | *Medium*
*10/16* | *#74, #76, #80, #81, #83, #86, #95, #96, #98, #108, #112* | *Remaining issues* | *We found out that a lot of our code is incorrect and needs to be redone. We understand now what has been causing us confusion and problems, but it will take a lot of work to make sure that everything is back on track.* | *Low*
*10/18* | *#69, #78, #87, #89, #90, #103, #105, #121, #130* | *Remaining Issues* | *We need to make sure that we finish the rest of the sprint requirements as best as we can now that we know how to get it working.* | *Medium-low*
 

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* We completed all of the user stories in our Sprint Backlog
* Epics 63,64,70,71,72,73


#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* None


#### What went well
* We did a good job problem-solving as a group


#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* We had limited understanding of what we were doing when we first started so we had to revise our plan midway through the sprint and rewrite a lot of code.


## Retrospective
Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | *Making sure that we have better communication and more time to meet up as a team.* | *Create more issues and make sure to ask for reviews on every pull request. Create better tests for our code, and make sure that each merge we make to master contains only a small update.* | *Use Zenhub much more extensively and communicate more on slack.*
What we did well | *Communication was much better and teamwork improved a lot.* | *We made sure to create way more issues for every little fix, and we had a much more organized process for making merges with master.* | *We used slack much more effectively for communication, and Zenhub was much more helpful.*
What we need to work on | *Keeping on top of our issues to make sure that we don't fall behind and become overwhelmed with work.* | *Creating tests for each new method header, and making sure master is well tested.* | *Make sure we pay better attention to the information at our disposal so that we are better prepared to complete our tasks.*
What we will change next time | *Making sure we stay on the same page and communicate with everyone for every major change.* | *Create more tests and make sure our code is well tested prior to each merge.* | *Improve our use of Zenhub and slack, and incorporate IntelliJ more in our testing.*
